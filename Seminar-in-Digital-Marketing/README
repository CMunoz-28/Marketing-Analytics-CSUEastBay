#Welcome to my Seminar in Digital Marketing Analytics repository! 

This project is a deep dive into the end-to-end process of survey-based research, 
where I explored data collection, analysis, and visualizationâ€”all while refining my technical and analytical skills.

ðŸ“‹ The Process: Crafting a Thoughtful Survey
Designing a survey isnâ€™t just about asking questionsâ€”itâ€™s about asking the right questions. This project required careful thought in crafting questions that were both valuable and quantifiable, 
ensuring they could yield meaningful insights. 
Through multiple iterations, I refined the survey to balance clarity and depth, making it an insightful exercise in real-world market research methodology.
