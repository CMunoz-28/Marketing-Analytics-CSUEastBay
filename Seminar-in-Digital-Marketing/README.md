# Seminar in Digital Marketing – Advanced Analytics & Optimization

**Course:** Seminar in Digital Marketing

**Program:** Master of Science in Marketing Analytics

**Institution:** California State University, East Bay

---

## Course Overview

This folder contains advanced analytical projects completed as part of the **Seminar in Digital Marketing**, with a focus on **regression modeling, optimization techniques, and data-driven decision-making** for digital marketing performance.

Projects emphasize how quantitative methods can be applied to optimize key marketing outcomes such as **clicks, conversions, revenue, and profit** across digital channels.

---

## Analytical Objectives

Across the seminar projects, the objectives include:

* Modeling relationships between marketing inputs and performance outcomes
* Applying regression analysis to predict clicks and conversions
* Using optimization techniques to allocate resources efficiently
* Translating analytical results into actionable marketing decisions

---

## Project Architecture

The seminar work is organized by **analytical technique**, separating **regression modeling** from **optimization-based decision analysis** to ensure clarity and reproducibility.
