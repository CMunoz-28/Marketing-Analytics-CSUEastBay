# 📊 Seminar in Digital Marketing

**Advanced Analytics, Regression & Optimization**

**Course:** Seminar in Digital Marketing

**Program:** Master of Science in Marketing Analytics

**Institution:** California State University, East Bay

---

## Course Overview

This folder contains advanced analytical projects completed as part of the **Seminar in Digital Marketing**, with an emphasis on applying **quantitative modeling and optimization techniques** to real-world digital marketing decisions.

The work demonstrates how **regression analysis and optimization frameworks** can be used to predict performance, allocate resources, and maximize key marketing outcomes such as **clicks, conversions, revenue, and profit**.

---

## Analytical Focus Areas

Projects in this seminar address the following objectives:

* Model relationships between marketing inputs and performance outcomes
* Predict digital marketing KPIs using regression analysis
* Optimize marketing decisions under constraints
* Evaluate trade-offs between competing objectives
* Translate analytical results into actionable business insights

---

## Project Architecture

The seminar projects are organized by **analytical method**, following a structure commonly used in professional analytics and marketing operations teams.

### Architecture Rationale

* **Regression/**
  Focuses on predictive modeling to estimate the impact of marketing variables on outcomes such as clicks and conversions.

* **Optimization/**
  Applies constraint-based optimization to determine how marketing resources should be allocated to maximize performance metrics.

* **Dashboards/**
  Contains decision-facing visual summaries used to communicate insights and results.

* **Assets/**
  Stores exported charts and figures used in reporting and documentation.

This structure emphasizes **reproducibility, clarity, and scalability**.
