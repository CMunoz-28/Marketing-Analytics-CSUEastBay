### Welcome to My Marketing Analytics Repository!

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

This collection showcases some of the work I've compiled while pursuing my master's degree in Marketing Analytics. 
It reflects my learning, growth, and application techniques in analytics to solve marketing challenges.

I believe there is much more to explore and achieve in this field. This repository is just the beginning of an exciting journey, and I am thrilled to see how these projects will evolve and contribute to real-world scenarios.

Thank you for stopping by, and I hope you find my work inspiring and insightful!
