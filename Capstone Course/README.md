# Marketing Analytics Capstone Project

**Customer Churn Prediction & Strategic Retention Insights**

**Course:** Marketing Analytics Capstone
**Program:** Master of Science in Marketing Analytics
**Institution:** California State University, East Bay

---

## Project Overview

This capstone project focuses on identifying and predicting **customer churn** using an end-to-end marketing analytics workflow. The objective was to analyze customer data, uncover key churn drivers, and translate analytical findings into **actionable retention strategies** for marketing and business decision-makers.

The project integrates **data preparation, exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and visualization** to support evidence-based marketing recommendations. All data used in this project is anonymized and intended for academic purposes only.

---

## Research Objectives

The primary goals of this project were to:

* Identify key customer characteristics and behaviors associated with churn
* Build and evaluate predictive models to estimate churn likelihood
* Assess model performance using appropriate evaluation metrics
* Translate analytical results into actionable marketing and retention insights

---

## Data Description

* **Data Type:** Customer-level behavioral and account data
* **Observations:** ~7,000 customer records
* **Variables:** Demographics, service usage, contract attributes, billing and payment behaviors
* **Target Variable:** Customer churn (binary outcome)

All brand identifiers and proprietary references have been removed or anonymized to ensure academic and ethical use.

---

## Methodology & Analysis

This project followed a structured end-to-end analytics framework:

### 1. Data Preparation

* Data cleaning and validation
* Handling missing values and categorical encoding
* Feature selection and transformation

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Descriptive statistics and distribution analysis
* Churn rate comparison across customer segments
* Visualization of key relationships and patterns

### 3. Predictive Modeling

* Logistic regression modeling for churn prediction
* Model evaluation using ROC curves and AUC scores
* Interpretation of model coefficients to identify churn drivers

### 4. Visualization & Reporting

* Excel-based scenario analysis and pivot tables
* Interactive Tableau dashboard highlighting churn trends and predictors

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
* **Excel:** Pivot tables, scenario modeling
* **Tableau:** Interactive dashboards and data visualization

---

## Key Insights & Findings

* Customers on **month-to-month contracts** exhibited significantly higher churn rates
* **Shorter tenure** was strongly associated with increased churn risk
* **Electronic billing and paperless payment methods** showed distinct churn patterns
* Logistic regression achieved an **AUC score of 0.81**, indicating strong predictive performance

These findings highlight the importance of contract structure, customer tenure, and billing preferences in churn behavior.

---

## Deliverables

* Python notebooks documenting EDA and predictive modeling
* Excel analysis files with scenario modeling and pivot tables
* Tableau dashboard visualizing churn drivers and customer segments

---

## Marketing & Business Implications

Insights from this analysis can support:

* Targeted retention campaigns for high-risk customer segments
* Incentive strategies to transition customers from month-to-month to longer contracts
* Personalized onboarding and engagement strategies for early-tenure customers
* Data-driven decision-making for customer lifecycle management

---

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements include:

* Incorporating additional behavioral or interaction data
* Testing alternative machine learning models (e.g., random forest, gradient boosting)
* Implementing real-time churn scoring for campaign activation
* Evaluating uplift modeling for targeted retention offers
